## Tips for Maximizing Parallel Development

### Context Switching Strategy:
1. **Morning:** Work on "thinking-heavy" tasks (new features, architecture decisions)
2. **Afternoon:** Work on "implementation-heavy" tasks (UI components, styling, testing)

### Parallel Work Example:
**Day 1 of Phase 1:**
- **Morning (4h):** Story 1.1 - Tamagui setup (Track A)
- **Afternoon (4h):** Story 1.3 - Supabase Auth integration (Track B)

Both tracks are independent, so you can make progress on both in one day!

### When NOT to Parallelize:
- Phase 0 (everything is sequential)
- Phase 5 (deployment steps are sequential)
- When you're stuck/debugging (focus on one thing)
- When learning something new (focus deeply)

### Git Branch Strategy:
```
feature/0.1-turborepo-setup
feature/1.1-tamagui-setup
feature/1.3-auth-integration

Work on multiple branches, merge when complete
```
